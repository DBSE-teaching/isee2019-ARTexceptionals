<h1>Project Basic Prototype</h1><br>
  
 <hr><br>
 
 <h1>Overview</h1><br>
 <p>Hello, welcome to the second blog of our project. In the previous blog, we introduced our team and which android app we’ll proceed with. In this blog, we’ll discuss about the customer requirements and user stories of our app.</p>
 <br><br><hr><br>

<h1>Requirements</h1><br>

<p>Requirement gathering is a first and essential step for developing an android app. We gathered requirements from client over series of meetings and also we have created a questionnaire for customer to fill it as per their requirement. The gathered requirements have been analyzed and categorized as Essential, Necessary and Desirable Requirements</p>
<h2>1. Essential Requirements:</h2><br>
 <p><&nbsp>• Details/Parameters of expense/income? (Category, note, date, place, camera for receipt)<br>
	<&nbsp><&nbsp>a. Customisable category, deleting option<br>
	<&nbsp><&nbsp>b. Payment method of income and expenditure<br>
	<&nbsp><&nbsp>c. Free text note<br>
	<&nbsp><&nbsp>d. Date<br>
	<&nbsp>• The application should work offline<br> 
	<&nbsp>• Application should store the data locally, one user is fine.<br> 
	<&nbsp>• Security feature(Pin for the app)<br> 
	<&nbsp>• Statistics<br></p>
<h2>2. Necessary Requirements:</h2><br>
 <p><&nbsp>• Security question to retrieve forgotten password. Take the answer for security question while setting the pin<br>
	<&nbsp>• The data needs to be filtered based on time, type of payment, catagory, range of money<br>
	<&nbsp>• Currency change support<br></p> 
<h2>3. Desirable Requirements:</h2><br>
 <p><&nbsp>• Sharing expense with other users<br>
	<&nbsp>• Summarise monthly expenses in mail<br>
	<&nbsp>• Store data on server/firebase<br>
	<&nbsp>• Sync at particular time with firebase server<br></p> 

<h1>Wrong Assumptions</h1><br>
<p>1. By exploring various money control apps, we have presumed certain features need to be added in the app but after meeting client, we got clarification what to include and what to exclude. Some of our wrong assumptions are:<br>
<nbsp>•	Our assumption was to include multiple bank accounts in the app but the requirement is to monitor transactions of only one account.<br>
<nbsp>• Barcode scanning is not required.<br>
<nbsp>• We assumed that Login authentication should be given using google, fb or email whereas the client requirement is pin authentication.<br>
<nbsp>• We got to know filtering the expenses based on Payment type, Range of money and category is required along with just date (initial assumption).</p>

<h1>User Stories</h1><br>
<p> Our project is divided in to four Epics, each Epic consists of Stories and each stories will be further divided as Tasks. The same Tasks have been carried to our Scrum board. Please find the User stories diagram as shown below: </p>

  <p>A product comes into its true colour only when each of the jigsaw pieces align properly. A team functions smoothly only when the team members work together. The gaps in the skills of one person needs to be covered by some other. Keeping this in mind, we will have regular standup meets to identify these gaps, discuss the challenges and help each other in growing as individual. Even though we have assigned roles for ourselves, we are not sandboxing ourselves to its parameters. This mindset is necessary for the flexibility of the team and thereby working seamlessly.</p>
