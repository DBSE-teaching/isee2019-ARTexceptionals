<h1>Overview</h1>
<p> “It’s time for some testing!”<br>
Hello and welcome to our penultimate blog for the series of ‘YourEuro’ - A money control app. In this blog we discuss in detail the process of testing which we followed to make our app flawless and make it Playstore ready.</p><hr><br>

<h1>Test Case Design</h1><br>
<p>Testing is a default part of software development package. It helps in enhancing the quality of the product, make it more reliable, give an effective performances and flawless experience. In the end these measures are required to stay in business.<br><br>  
In a team of 4, one of the members will be the developer for a feature while two other will be the code reviewer. The fourth person will not participate in the code review and thereby be ignorant of the structure of the source code. He will act as a tester and write test cases for blackbox testing. And the same is repeated with different developer and tester for different features.
